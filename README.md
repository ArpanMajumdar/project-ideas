## Personalized youtube suggestions extension
Wait what? I thought youtube suggestions are already personalized. Why would I need an extension for that?

Let's say sometimes you want to watch some productive videos like how to manage time, ted talks etc but other times you just want to watch random cat videos. Well youtube personalization doesn't exactly tell you that you are watching a productive video or not. That's what we do.

### High level idea
- [ ] User can select which videos and channels are productive and which are not.
- [ ] User can tag them into various categories like gym, study, talks etc
- [ ] User can switch between productive and non-productive mode.
- [ ] If a non-productive video comes when user is in productive mode, we will show a warning and try to direct him to some productive video.
- [ ] User can set a max time limit for watching non-productive videos.
